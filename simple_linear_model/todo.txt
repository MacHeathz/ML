STUFF TO ADD
 XXX Repartition (randomly) train/val/test data as 60/20/20 percentages.
 XXX Automatically determine polynomial degree p, just like lambda, by calculating and plotting p (for example, 1:12) against the error. See also ex 2/3 polyFeature function for expanding multiple x's.
 XXX Automatically choose lambda and p using min() and ix to get and return value at the corresponding index.
 XXX Plot all data points and endresult of model at the end
 XXX Somehow prevent the model from underfitting by testing p / lambda combinations
 * Implement gradient descent for large datasets
 * Cleanup code, remove cruft etc.
