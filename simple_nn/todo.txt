STUFF TO ADD
 * Partition data in train, val and test data (60/20/20)
 * Use layer_size vector to initialize theta's for different amounts of layers
 * Automatically choose complexity, number of hidden units/layers a la ex5
 * Automatically choose lambda regularization parameter a la ex5
 * Use gradient descent for large datasets, fminunc otherwise
 * Plot learning curves
